Hi! I'm Benjamin and I'm new to programming. I developed an interest for it a while ago, but now decided to start doing it. 
For my first project I created a portfolio website. This is more in the way of front-end development as that's the area where I want to grow in now.
If you have feedback please let me know as I want to improve as a developer. 

<h2>The website</h2>
The website is to be used as my portfolio. The website consists of two pages. The homepage where I tell a little about myself and the projects page. 
The projects page is made to showcase the different projects I worked on. They also link to the Github repository. 
I consider this project far from done, but I'm proud of what I have made. It's based off a template from templated.co, but it served as a good base for the website I had in mind. 
I'll definitely keep working on it to include other features. Whenever I do I'll post the updates on the repository.
